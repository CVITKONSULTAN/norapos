When adding complex node:
    Disconnet from flow simpleFlow with subnodes:
        Save in node attributes links to simple flow(array of ids in simple flow)
        Set display none to simple flow(nodes and connections)
    Render subnodes in parent original node using links from node attributes(ids of simple flow nodes):
    Render position:
        In big flow just increase position number by node_attributes length
        When rendering node which has node_attributes just set position number of subnodes:
            increase by 1 begins from position number of parent node

When click renderNodeSettings:
    Connect all simple flows:
        Set display(e. g. from none to original)) to all nodes and connections
            (just traverse all and if display is none then set display to original)
        Traverse all nodes and if node has node_attributes then:
            Using ids form node_attributes find simple flow and connect it(just connect head and tail of simpleFlow);
            Update all flows if needed(using function for updating in BinaryFlow)
